# 🚧 Module 08: Error Handling

Error handling is the skill of writing programs that **fail safely**, communicate clearly, and recover when possible. This module teaches how to use exceptions, write defensive checks, create custom errors, and log failures for real-world debugging.

> **Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
> **Prerequisites:** Module 01 (Foundations)  
> **Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ Upper-Intermediate

## 📚 Topics Covered

| # | Topic | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 01 | [Exceptions](01_exceptions/) | What exceptions are and why they exist | raise, built-in errors, stack trace |
| 02 | [Try/Except/Finally](02_try_except_finally/) | Catching, handling, and cleaning up | try, except, else, finally |
| 03 | [Custom Exceptions](03_custom_exceptions/) | Defining your own error types | subclasses, hierarchy, messages |
| 04 | [Defensive Programming](04_defensive_programming/) | Preventing errors before they happen | validation, guards, assertions |
| 05 | [Logging](05_logging/) | Recording errors and context | logging levels, handlers, tracebacks |

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain what exceptions are and how they propagate.
- Use try/except/else/finally to handle failures safely.
- Create custom exceptions to make errors meaningful.
- Apply defensive checks to avoid fragile code paths.
- Log errors with enough context to debug real issues.
