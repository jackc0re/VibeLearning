# Exercise 1: The Book Class
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Create a class called `Book`.
# 2. It should have an `__init__` method that accepts `title`, `author`, and `pages`.
# 3. Add a method called `description` that returns a string formatted like:
#    "<Title> by <Author>, <Pages> pages"
# 4. Create two instances of `Book` and print their descriptions.

class Book:
    # TODO: Implement this class
    pass

# TODO: Create instances and test your class here
print("\n--- Exercise 1 Output ---")


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: Bank Account
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Create a class called `BankAccount`.
# 2. In `__init__`, initialize an attribute `balance` to 0 (or a starting amount).
# 3. Add a method `deposit(amount)` that adds to the balance.
# 4. Add a method `withdraw(amount)` that subtracts from the balance.
#    - Optional: Add a check to ensure they can't withdraw more than they have!
# 5. Add a method `check_balance()` that prints the current balance.
# 6. Test your class by creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing, and checking balance.

class BankAccount:
    # TODO: Implement this class
    pass

# TODO: Create instances and test your class here
print("\n--- Exercise 2 Output ---")
