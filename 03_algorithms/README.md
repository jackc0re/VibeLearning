## 🧠 Why Algorithms Matter

```
"An algorithm must be seen to be believed." — Donald Knuth
```

Understanding algorithms helps you:

1. **Write efficient code** — Choose the right approach for each problem
2. **Pass technical interviews** — Algorithms are a core interview topic
3. **Think systematically** — Break complex problems into manageable steps
4. **Optimize performance** — Know when O(n) vs O(n²) matters

## 📖 How to Study This Module

### Step 1: Understand the Concept
Read each topic's README to understand:
- What problem the algorithm solves
- How it works (step by step)
- When to use it
- Time and space complexity

### Step 2: Study the Examples
Run and modify `examples.py` to see algorithms in action:
```bash
cd 03_algorithms/01_searching
python examples.py
```

### Step 3: Practice
Complete the exercises in `exercises.py`:
- Start with the easier problems
- Write code before looking at hints
- Test with different inputs

### Step 4: Test Your Knowledge
Take the quiz in `quiz.md` to verify understanding.

## 🔑 Key Complexity Classes

Understanding Big-O notation is crucial for this module:

| Notation | Name | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant | Array access by index |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| O(n) | Linear | Linear search |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Bubble sort |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | Naive recursive fibonacci |

01_searching ──────┐
                   ├──► 03_recursion ──► 04_dynamic_programming
02_sorting ────────┤                          │
                   │                          ▼

02_sorting ──────────► 07_graph_algorithms (uses DFS/BFS)
```

**Recommended order:**
1. Start with **Searching** — simplest algorithms
2. Move to **Sorting** — builds on comparisons
3. Learn **Recursion** — fundamental technique
4. Study **Divide and Conquer** — applies recursion
5. Tackle **Dynamic Programming** — optimizes recursion
6. Explore **Greedy Algorithms** — alternative approach
7. Finish with **Graph Algorithms** — combines everything

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Trace through by hand** — Draw arrays and step through algorithms on paper
2. **Visualize** — Use sites like [visualgo.net](https://visualgo.net/) to see algorithms animate
3. **Implement from scratch** — Don't just read, write the code yourself
4. **Analyze complexity** — Always think about time and space
5. **Practice variations** — Same algorithm, different problems
