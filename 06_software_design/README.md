# 🧠 Module 06: Software Design

Software design is about writing code that stays **readable, changeable, and reliable** as it grows. This module focuses on practical design principles you can apply daily — even in small scripts — to reduce bugs and make future changes easier.

> **Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
> **Prerequisites:** Module 01 (Foundations), Module 04 (OOP Concepts), Module 05 (Functional Programming)  
> **Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ Upper-Intermediate

## 📚 Topics Covered

| # | Topic | Description | Key Concepts |
|---|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 01 | [DRY Principle](01_dry_principle/) | Remove duplication and centralize knowledge | duplication, single source of truth |
| 02 | [KISS Principle](02_kiss_principle/) | Prefer simple solutions that are easy to understand | simplicity, readability |
| 03 | [YAGNI Principle](03_yagni_principle/) | Build what you need now, not what you might need later | scope, overengineering |
| 04 | [Separation of Concerns](04_separation_of_concerns/) | Split responsibilities so each part has one job | layers, boundaries, modules |
| 05 | [Coupling and Cohesion](05_coupling_and_cohesion/) | Design for low coupling and high cohesion | dependencies, responsibility |
| 06 | [Code Smells](06_code_smells/) | Recognize warning signs of maintainability issues | long functions, god objects |
| 07 | [Refactoring](07_refactoring/) | Improve code structure without changing behavior | safe changes, small steps |

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Spot duplication and apply DRY without over-abstracting.
- Choose simpler designs and explain why they’re safer.
- Avoid speculative features and premature abstractions (YAGNI).
- Organize code by responsibility using separation of concerns.
- Reduce coupling, increase cohesion, and understand trade-offs.
- Identify common code smells and propose concrete improvements.
- Refactor confidently using small, behavior-preserving steps.
