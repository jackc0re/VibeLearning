## 📚 How to Use These Exercises

1. **Start at your level** — Don't jump to advanced if you're struggling with basics
2. **Try without solutions** — Spend 15-30 minutes before checking
3. **Understand the solution** — Don't just copy, understand WHY it works
4. **Modify and experiment** — Change inputs, add features, break things on purpose

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Time yourself** — Track how long each exercise takes
2. **Write pseudocode first** — Plan before you code
3. **Test edge cases** — Empty inputs, large numbers, duplicates
4. **Comment your code** — Explain your thought process
5. **Review regularly** — Come back to earlier exercises after learning more

## 🚀 Getting Started

Pick your level and dive in:

```bash
# If you're new to programming
cd beginner

# If you know OOP and algorithms
cd intermediate

# If you're comfortable with all concepts
cd advanced
```

**Happy coding!** 💻
