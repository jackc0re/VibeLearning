## Project Workflow

For each project, follow this approach:

1. **Phase 1: Planning** (30 minutes)
   - Read the requirements carefully
   - Design your data structures and functions
   - Write pseudocode for key features

2. **Phase 2: Implementation** (2-4 hours)
   - Build core functionality first
   - Add error handling
   - Implement user interface

3. **Phase 3: Testing** (30 minutes)
   - Test with various inputs
   - Handle edge cases
   - Fix bugs

4. **Phase 4: Enhancement** (optional)
   - Complete challenge tasks
   - Refactor code
   - Add your own features

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't copy-paste** — Type the code yourself to learn muscle memory
2. **Break it down** — Divide large projects into smaller, manageable tasks
3. **Validate often** — Test your code frequently as you build
4. **Read solutions** — Learn from the provided solution code
5. **Make it yours** - Add personal touches and features

## Next Steps

Pick your project based on your current skill level:

```bash
# Beginner: Start with Calculator
cd 01_calculator

# Intermediate: Try Todo App or File Organizer
cd 02_todo_app
# or
cd 03_file_organizer

# Advanced: Tackle Data Analyzer
cd 04_data_analyzer
```

**Happy building!** 🛠️
