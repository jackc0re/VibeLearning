# 🔁 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a workflow where you write tests **before** implementation code.
The goal is not "more tests", but **better feedback** and **better design**.

---

## ✅ The TDD Cycle: Red → Green → Refactor

1) **Red**: write a failing test that describes a small behavior
2) **Green**: implement the simplest code that makes the test pass
3) **Refactor**: improve code structure without changing behavior

---

## ✅ When TDD Helps Most

- Business logic with many edge cases
- Code that should be stable over time
- When you want confidence to refactor

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Writing huge tests first (too much at once)
- Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- Skipping refactoring (code becomes messy)

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- TDD is about **small steps**.
- Each test should add a new behavior.
- Refactor with confidence after tests are green.
