# 🎨 Module 07: Design Patterns

Design patterns are **reusable solutions** to common software design problems. They help you communicate ideas clearly, avoid reinventing the wheel, and build systems that are easier to change and extend.

> **Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours  
> **Prerequisites:** Module 04 (OOP Concepts), Module 06 (Software Design)  
> **Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced
