## Key Concepts Preview

### Variables
```python
name = "Alice"      # A string (text)
age = 25            # An integer (whole number)
height = 1.75       # A float (decimal number)
is_student = True   # A boolean (True/False)
```

### Operators
```python
total = 10 + 5      # Math: 15
is_adult = age >= 18  # Comparison: True
can_vote = is_adult and is_citizen  # Logic
```

### Control Flow
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("Too young to vote.")
```

### Loops
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

while count < 10:
    count += 1
```

### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("World")  # "Hello, World!"
```

### Input/Output
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}!")
```
