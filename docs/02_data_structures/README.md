## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- ✅ Master Python's built-in data structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- ✅ Understand when to use each data structure
- ✅ Implement classic structures from scratch (linked lists, trees)
- ✅ Analyze time complexity of common operations
- ✅ Choose the right structure for different problems

## Key Concepts Preview

### Lists — Ordered, Mutable
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")      # Add to end
fruits[0] = "apricot"      # Modify by index
```

### Dictionaries — Key-Value Pairs
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
person["city"] = "NYC"     # Add new key
print(person["name"])      # Access by key
```

### Sets — Unique Elements
```python
unique = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3}   # {1, 2, 3}
a = {1, 2}
b = {2, 3}
print(a | b)               # Union: {1, 2, 3}
```

### Choosing the Right Structure

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Ordered collection, duplicates OK | `list` |
| Fast key lookups | `dict` |
| Unique elements only | `set` |
| Immutable sequence | `tuple` |
| Last-in-first-out | Stack (list) |
| First-in-first-out | Queue (deque) |
