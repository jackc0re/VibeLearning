# 🎱 Module 04: OOP Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into "objects" that contain data and behavior. This module covers the core pillars of OOP and advanced design principles.

## 📂 Topics Covered

1. **[Classes and Objects](01_classes_and_objects/README.md)**
   - The blueprint (Class) and the instance (Object).
   - Attributes (`__init__`) and Methods.

2. **[Encapsulation](02_encapsulation/README.md)**
   - Hiding internal state.
   - Public, Protected (`_`), and Private (`__`) members.
   - Getters, Setters, and Property Decorators.

3. **[Inheritance](03_inheritance/README.md)**
   - Creating hierarchies (Parent -> Child).
   - `super()` and method overriding.

4. **[Polymorphism](04_polymorphism/README.md)**
   - "Many forms".
   - Duck Typing.
   - Operator Overloading (Magic Methods).

5. **[Abstraction](05_abstraction/README.md)**
   - Hiding implementation details.
   - Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) and Interfaces.

6. **[Composition vs Inheritance](06_composition_vs_inheritance/README.md)**
   - "Has-A" vs "Is-A" relationships.
   - Why you should favor composition.

7. **[SOLID Principles](07_solid_principles/README.md)**
   - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 🧠 Prerequisites

- Module 01 (Foundations)
- Module 02 (Data Structures)

## 🚀 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Design classes that model real-world entities.
- Protect your data using encapsulation.
- Reuse code effectively using inheritance and composition.
- Write flexible code using polymorphism and abstraction.
- Apply industry-standard design principles (SOLID).
