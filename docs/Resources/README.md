| [Data Structures](cheatsheets/data_structures.md) | List/dict/set/tuple methods and operations | When working with collections |
| [OOP](cheatsheets/oop_cheatsheet.md) | Classes, inheritance, magic methods, SOLID | When designing classes |
| [Functional Programming](cheatsheets/functional.md) | Lambdas, map/filter/reduce, closures | When writing functional code |
| [File I/O](cheatsheets/file_io.md) | File modes, JSON/CSV, pathlib | When handling files |
| [Algorithms](cheatsheets/algorithms.md) | Big O notation, sorting, searching | When analyzing performance |

## How to Use These Resources

### During Learning

1. **Before a module** — Skim relevant sections to familiarize yourself
2. **While learning** — Reference cheatsheets when you forget syntax
3. **After a module** — Check glossary for terms you don't fully understand
4. **Between modules** — Explore further reading to go deeper

### Quick Reference

- **Forgot how to sort a list?** → Check `data_structures.md`
- **Need Big O lookup?** → Check `algorithms.md`
- **Confused about 'polymorphism'?** → Check `glossary.md`
- **Want book recommendations?** → Check `further_reading.md`

## Tips for Effective Use

### ✅ Do

- **Print cheatsheets** — Having physical references helps muscle memory
- **Bookmark often-used sections** — Quick access to what you need most
- **Cross-reference with modules** — See where terms and concepts are applied
- **Share with peers** — Teaching helps reinforce your understanding

### ❌ Don't

- **Don't memorize everything** — Cheatsheets are for reference, not memorization
- **Don't skip the modules** — Resources supplement, don't replace, the main curriculum
- **Don't overwhelm yourself** — Use resources as needed, not all at once
