## 🗺️ How to Use This Repository

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with `00_getting_started/`** - Make sure your environment is set up
2. **Follow the numbered modules** - They're ordered from basic to advanced
3. **For each concept:**
   - Read the `README.md` for theory and explanations
   - Run `examples.py` to see the concept in action
   - Try `exercises.py` to practice
   - Check `quiz.md` to test your understanding

### Structure of Each Module

```
concept_name/
├── README.md      # Theory, explanation, real-world analogies
├── examples.py    # Runnable code examples
├── exercises.py   # Practice problems
└── quiz.md        # Quick knowledge check
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Navigate to any concept folder
cd 01_foundations/01_variables_and_types

# Run the examples
python examples.py
```
